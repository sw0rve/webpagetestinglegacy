<td valign="center"><center><font size="4"></fo>Behold, the beautiful, the stunning, my amazing girlfriend Rose!! She's a super skilled and talented digital artist who creates the most jaw-dropping, amazing artwork that you'll come across, like the one on the right of the page, she's also learning how to do 3D modeling too!! You should really check out more of her stuff on her <a href="https://twitter.com/IO_alira" target=_blank>Twitter</a></href> page where she mainly posts. She also streams video games and art draws on her <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dxmpsterfire_" target=_blank>Twitch</a></href> page. Some of her most favorite games are League of Legends, Roblox, Needy Streamer Overload, and Cookie Run Kingdom. You probably didn't need to know any of that, but this is Rose we're talking about, so it's best to hear ALL about her. I could go on and on about her all day and night, but I think I've written enough to get all my points across to whomever's reading this all. Love you Rose!!!</center></td>
