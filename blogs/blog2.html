<td valign="center"><center><font size="4"></fo>Alright, so I'm starting to get tired of manually programming this site in base HTML, so I've figured out that I could use a much easier solution to this issue, using Adobe Flash. Yeah I know the program got renamed to Adobe Animate because of the discontinuation of Adobe Flash Player and all that shit, but I think the name Adobe Flash is more recognizable than Adobe Animate, so I'll just be referring to it by that. Anyways, Flash has an option where you can export your document to an webpage using HTML and JavaScript. This is definitely a big step up from manually programming since I can just easily slap a couple objects on a Flash document and just export it then and there. This opens much more room and posibilities for more cool looking shit without it taking 10 years to do so. (Considering I almost don't even know how to code that much.) With these tools, I will be revamping the whole site to this type of format, though It'll probably take some time. A lot of time. In the meantime, enjoy the current test I created.</center></td>
